            </h2>
            <p class="color-black padding-25 justify">
              Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and
              businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal),
              SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a
              multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up
              company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. <br />
              <br />
              Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket
              that would send the first commercial vehicle to the International
              Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of
              SolarCity in 2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of
              industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of
              President Donald Trump's administration. <br />
              <br />
              In January 2021, Musk reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as the
              wealthiest man in the world.

              Education
            </h2>
            <p class="color-black padding-25 justify">
              At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s
              University and avoid mandatory service in the South African
              military. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in
              part because he felt it would be easier to obtain American
              citizenship via that path.<br /><br />

              In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the
              University of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate
              degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in
              physics.<br /><br />

              After leaving Penn. He launched his first company, Zip2
              Corporation in 1995. Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002.

              About Tesla Motors
            </h1>
            <p class="color-white justify">
              Musk is the co-founder, CEO and product architect at Tesla Motors,
              a company formed in 2003 that is dedicated to producing
              affordable, mass-market electric cars as well as battery products
              and solar roofs. Musk oversees all product development,
              engineering and design of the company's products. <br /><br />
            </p>
            <p class="color-white justify">
              After initially aiming to produce 5,000 new Model 3 cars per week
              by December 2017, Musk pushed that goal back to March 2018, and
              then to June with the start of the new year. The announced delay
              didn't surprise industry experts, who were well aware of the
              company's production problems, though some questioned how long
              investors would remain patient with the process. It also didn't
              prevent Musk from garnering a radical new compensation package as
              CEO, in which he would be paid after reaching milestones of
              growing valuation based on $50 billion increments.<br /><br />

              By April 2018, with Tesla expected to fall short of first-quarter
              production forecasts, news surfaced that Musk had pushed aside the
              head of engineering to personally oversee efforts in that
              division. In a Twitter exchange with a reporter, Musk said it was
              important to "divide and conquer" to meet production goals and was
              "back to sleeping at factory." <br /><br />
